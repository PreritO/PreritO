### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

I'm a graduate student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign studying computer engineering. I am interested in building scalable infrastructure for applications in data centers, focusing on both the hardware and software stack.

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on understanding the memory hierarchy for GPUs and how it can be exploited for Deep Learning Applications.  
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning web developement to stay on top of my coding skills.  
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m open to collaboration so just find me on Twitter! 
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with GPU architecture. If you have any recommended reading, send them my way!
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about anything, I'm always down to chat.
